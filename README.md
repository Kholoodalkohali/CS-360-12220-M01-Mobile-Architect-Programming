# Event Tracking App
- For Project Three, I developed an Event Tracking App, designed to help users keep track of important events efficiently. The primary goal was to provide an intuitive way to log, organize, and receive reminders for upcoming events. The app aimed to address the common user need of staying organized while ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

- To support these needs, I focused on designing clear and accessible UI screens, including a login screen, event dashboard, and event creation form. Features such as input validation, reminders, and a visually clean layout ensured that users could navigate the app easily. My design choices prioritized clarity, accessibility, and engagement, making the UI both functional and aesthetically appealing.

= On the development side, I followed a modular coding approach, breaking the project into manageable components. By using best practices like reusable functions, structured data handling, and efficient navigation, I ensured that the app was maintainable and scalable. These techniques will be useful in future projects where flexibility and ease of updates are important.

= Testing was a critical part of the development process. I conducted manual testing for UI responsiveness and functionality, alongside debugging tools to catch logical errors. This process helped uncover small UI inconsistencies and minor bugs before finalization, reinforcing the importance of iterative testing to improve user experience and app stability.

= Throughout the development cycle, I had to innovate in handling event reminders efficiently while ensuring that notifications worked seamlessly. One area where I successfully demonstrated my knowledge was in implementing a clean UI with a structured login and event management system, combining both front-end and back-end logic effectively.

= This project reinforced my understanding of user-centered design, structured coding, and thorough testingâ€”all of which will be crucial in future app development projects. Excited to hear about your experiences too!
